# sentence-arrays
saves sentences in an array of linear linked lists where each list node is a word
The program will prompt the user to enter a sentence. After the user finishes and presses the
"enter" key, the sentence will be sent to an array function where it will create a node for each
word and save the sentence in a linear linked list. Each array index will contain a sentence, and
each sentence will be a linear linked list.
The inspiration for this program came from trying to help a friend with a problem where they were
trying to do this kind of program.
